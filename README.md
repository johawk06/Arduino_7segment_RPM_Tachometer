# Arduino_7segment_RPM_Tachometer

Turn your Arduino into a high-revving Tachometer! Ô∏è

This project brings your car's engine to life with a real-time RPM display on a 7-segment display using an Arduino Uno and a SparkFun UART board.

Take it for a spin and  see your engine roar to life (metaphorically, on the display)  with this code!

Components used were an Arduino Uno, SparkFun OBD-II UART, and 7-segment display.  

This project showcases skills in:

Interfacing with hardware (Arduino, SparkFun UART board, 7-segment display)
Serial communication
OBD-II data parsing
Embedded C programming
